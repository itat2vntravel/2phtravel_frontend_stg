                Filipino cuisine is composed of the cuisines of more than a
                hundred distinct ethnolinguistic groups found throughout the
                Philippine archipelago.Adobo is one of the most popular Filipino
                dishes and is considered unofficially by many as the national
                dish. It usually consists of pork or chicken, sometimes both,
                stewed or braised in a sauce usually made from vinegar, cooking
                oil, garlic, bay leaf, peppercorns, and soy sauce.

                This dish has the chicken marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, and
                garlic for several hours. The chicken is pan fried until it
                develops a nice brown crust, then the marinade is added into the
                pan to create a thick glaze before the chicken is served with
                rice. âAdoboâ refers to the vinegar marinating process
                originally used for food preservation, and while many other
                cuisines have incorporated the technique in different ways, itâs
                believed to have originated in the Philippines.

                Also known as âsizzling sisig,â pork sisig features meat from
                the pigâs head (including the ears and snout) marinated in
                vinegar and served with chicken liver. This indulgent, fatty
                dish is often served on a sizzling plate and topped with a raw
                egg, making the egg whites cook right on top of the food. While
                pigâs head is traditional, you can get really creative with this
                dish. For instance, San Franciscoâs Elena Una restaurant offers
                you a choice of oyster, tofu-mushroom, or bagnet (crispy pork
                belly) sisig!

                With the holidays upon us, it wouldnât be right to leave off
                this holiday dessert. Traditionally served at Christmastime in
                the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Philippines, the bibingka is a
                coconut rice cake thatâs mildly sweet. While another tradition
                includes cooking the cakes in special terra cotta pots and
                banana leaves with hot coals surrounding it (giving the bibingka
                a pleasant charred crust), modern cooks can replicate that
                caramelization by placing a nearly done bibingka under the
                broiler.

                Filipino values are, for the most part, centered around
                maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to
                be accepted within a group. The main sanction against diverging
                from these values are the concepts of Hiya, roughly translated
                as a sense of shame, and Amor propio or self-esteem.

                spirit can be witnessed during festivals such as Ati-Atihan,
                Kaamulan, Panabenga, and the famous 3-month-celebration for
                Christmas. Jesusâ birthday is a massive fiesta in the
                Philippines. The celebrations start in October with decorations
                and music and peak in December with carols, mass, and midnight
                feasting.

                Society norms and values are of utmost importance in the
                Philippines. Filipino values are primarily rooted in
                relationships and societal obligations. Children are taught to
                be respectful from the early stages of their life, by
                introducing phrases âpoâ and âopoâ when talking to adults.
                Societal and group acceptance is very much sought after in
                Filipino society. Attending to what people think and respecting
                everyone is a vital part of Filipino values.
